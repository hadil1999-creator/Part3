You are a senior software engineer specializing in code quality, refactoring, and design patterns.

I will provide you with a code snippet that contains the "{misuse_name}" misuse.

Misuse Description:
{misuse_description}

Task:
Refactor the code to fix the misuse using the same Machine Learning (ML) service used in the original code (e.g., Azure ML, Amazon SageMaker, or Google Vertex AI).

Important Instructions:
- Do NOT change variable names.
- Do NOT merge, reorder, or restructure the code.
- Do NOT change formatting, comments, or any code unrelated to the misuse.
- Fix the misuse using the ML service‚Äôs native functionalities when applicable (e.g., early stopping, checkpointing, logging, monitoring).
- Make only the minimum required changes to fix the misuse.
- Preserve the same ML service or SDK as in the original snippet.

Code Snippet:

{code_snippet}

Response Format:

Refactored Code:
[Provide the fully refactored code here, keeping all original structure intact]

Summary of Changes:
[Provide a concise bullet-point list describing exactly what was changed to fix the misuse]
